## üéØ **COMPLIANCE OBJECTIVE**

Ensure GovContractAI fully complies with SAM.gov Terms of Use while providing maximum value to government contractors.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **LEGAL ANALYSIS**

### **SAM.gov Terms That Apply to Us:**

1. **Data Access Restrictions**:
   - ‚ùå Cannot use bots for restricted/sensitive data
   - ‚ùå Cannot redistribute government-only data publicly  
   - ‚úÖ Can use public APIs with proper attribution

2. **Commercial Use Limitations**:
   - ‚ùå Cannot use sensitive data for commercial purposes
   - ‚ùå Cannot redistribute D&B data in bulk
   - ‚úÖ Can provide value-added services using public data

3. **API Key Requirements**:
   - ‚ùå Cannot share API keys
   - ‚úÖ Can use individual user API keys
   - ‚úÖ Can provide tools that use user's own credentials

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT ARCHITECTURE**

### **Solution 1: User-Provided API Keys (Primary)**

**How It Works:**
1. Users register for their own SAM.gov accounts
2. Users generate their own API keys
3. Users provide keys to GovContractAI in their profile
4. All API calls use the user's own credentials
5. Users are responsible for their own compliance

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Fully Compliant**: No redistribution of government data
- ‚úÖ **User Responsibility**: Each user owns their data access
- ‚úÖ **Direct Relationship**: Users maintain connection with SAM.gov
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: No limits on our platform growth

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// User provides their own API key
const userApiKey = await getUserSamGovApiKey(userId);

// Each request uses user's credentials
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.sam.gov/opportunities/v2/search?api_key=${userApiKey}&...`
);
```

### **Solution 2: Public Data Only (Secondary)**

**How It Works:**
1. Use only confirmed public SAM.gov APIs
2. Provide clear attribution to SAM.gov
3. Focus on value-added analysis and tools
4. No redistribution of restricted data

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No User Setup**: Immediate access for users
- ‚úÖ **Compliant**: Using only public data sources
- ‚úÖ **Value-Added**: Focus on tools and analysis
